Convert-ASN1-asn1c version 0.04
===============================

This module let's you encode/decode BER encoded ASN.1 PDUs via the asn1c tools
enber/unber. The key difference to the Convert::ASN1 module on CPAN is that it
doesn't require (and can not make use of) the ASN.1 specification for the PDUs
you want to de/encode.

Please see the module documentation (perldoc Convert::ASN1::asn1c) for more
information on how this module is used.

executables have to be in your $PATH for this module to find them!
