Revision history for Perl extension Convert::ASN1::asn1c.

0.01  Mon Sep 13 10:13:54 2010
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AX -n Convert::ASN1::asn1c

0.02  Tue Sep 14 10:18:00 2010
	- added META.yml so that CPAN Testers knows about this modules dependencies
    - changed test script so that tests that rely on unber/enber are skipped if
      those are not found because there is no possibility (that I know of) to
      specify non-perl dependencies (i.e., dependencies on external programs).

0.03  Tue Sep 14 12:53:00 2010
	- the previous update didn't have the desired effect, as META.yml is
	  autogenerated by ExtUtils::MakeMaker, so I changed Makefile.PL now
	- fixed an error in the pod formatting of the documentation
